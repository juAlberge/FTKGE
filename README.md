## Fine-Tuning Knowledge Graph Embeddings

SODA Retreat 2023

### Goal
The goal of the project is to fine-tune the existing knowledge graph embeddings for downstream task using graph attention networks. Moreover, we would like to observe how the attentions behave with the fine-tuning.

### Datasets
- 5 downstream datasets
- Knowledge graph: YAGO3 2022 version
